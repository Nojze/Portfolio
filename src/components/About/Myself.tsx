    <Description>
      I&apos;m a Software Engineer with 5 years of experience under my belt, bringing a unique mix of technical skills,
      problem-solving abilities, and a passion for innovation to every project I work on. I&apos;m all about front-end
      and iOS development technologies like React, TypeScript, Next.js, React Native, Swift, SwiftUI and more. I love
      paying attention to detail and always strive to deliver the best user experience (UX/UI) possible, while also
      keeping accessibility and test automation in mind.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I&apos;m not working on code, you can find me keeping an eye on the stock market, hitting the gym, exploring
      new destinations, or making connections with interesting individuals. I believe in a balanced approach to life and
      work, and make sure to allocate time for activities that keep me inspired and energized.
